okay, problem: ,
.field-validation-erros {
    color: #b00b69
}
this thing. it's meant to change the color of the error messages that appear when you don't put anything in the boxes.
that, of ourse, didn't work.
it's a minor problem compared to what we USUALLY deal with, but. it's still a problem!
yay yippie yahoo more bullshit.
