alright, so. i'm assuming you read these notes too when trying to fix things that are borked?
anyways, the problems might not be the stupid, enum enun bullshit
that might be me making myself confused.
and for the record, the problem is, according to the code itself,
"The name 'PerfilEnum' does not exist in the current context"
which should be checked up on PerfilEnums.cs, i think.
don't take my word as gospel though.

shit is still fucked, gang!
i did also figure something out which is really choking my motivation
apperently, the next step after this thing is delt with
is to try to customize something so THAT works properly
but the THING IS.
EVOLUA SKIPS IT, SO WE ARE LEFT IN THE DARK ABOUT THIS!!!!!!
i'm going to kill something. somethings life ends with ME.
on the plus side the ai that keeps trying to help me is kinda funny
its as suicidal as we are :D'
sidenote, what is with this stupid ' changing the color of the text anyways'
if i knew how to do it on purpose it'd be permanently be purple
but i don't so it just swaps to red every time the ' symbol shows up.'
fun.
